 **FizzBuzz** is a classic beginner‑friendly programming challenge that tests your ability to use loops, conditionals, and basic logic.
 
 You’re will need to print a sequence of numbers, usually from 1 to 100, but with a twist:

+ If a number is divisible by 3, print “Fizz”

+ If it’s divisible by 5, print “Buzz”

+ If it’s divisible by both 3 and 5, print “FizzBuzz”

+ Otherwise, print the number itself
